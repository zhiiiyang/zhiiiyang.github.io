abstract: What is "the last mile" of analytics? It's the final step that one needs to take to deliver the insights of data and communicate results with decision-makers. R has made it easy for us to wrangle data and build models. With the power of the R Markdown family packages, your analysis can be easily turned into high-quality reproducible documents including reports, presentations, posters, webpages, and dashboards. It requires less time and efforts to create and maintain code, data, output, text in one single document, which leaves you more time working on your code.
