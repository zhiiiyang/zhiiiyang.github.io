This exam varies by province to province, so it is the admission rate to the top universities (Beijing/Tsinghua University). I often get asked how difficult to get into those two schools in China. I hope this data visualization will help you understand the admission rates of the top universities across different provinces in China by using the data in 2017.\n\rData visualization\rThe geo location of provinces in China was downloade from the R pacakge geofacet by Ryan Hafen. My first intention of starting this project was inspired by a talk introducing this package. As you can easily tell from the following plots, the style was gently borrowed from the geofacet.\nHigh admission rates in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai\rAs you probably notice from the plot below, there are three places with very different color patterns compared to the rest of the country. The gaokao is a province-based exam so that there might be some variations. But it is uncommon to see those highly favored results happened to occur in bigger cities. It is often critized that Beijing/Tsinghua University do admit more students from these three places. Then, you might ask whether there are more students living there because these are bigger cities. The admission rates range from 0.03% to 1.03% in 2017.\nggplot(rates, aes(col, row, label = province)) +\rgeom_tile(aes(fill = rate*100), colour = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, width=0.9, height=0.9, size=1.5, linejoin = \u0026quot;round\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_text() +\rscale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;#fde0dd\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;#c51b8a\u0026quot;, na.value = \u0026quot;#f0f0f0\u0026quot;, name = \u0026quot;Admissions\\nper 10,000\u0026quot;) +\rtheme_gray() +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot; Admission rates of Beijing/Tsinghua University in 2017\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)+\rtheme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;#f5f5f5\u0026quot;),\rplot.title = element_text(size=16, face=\u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, margin = margin(b = -20, t = 10)))\r\rUnproportional admission rates\rThen, I tried to add one more layer of information into the plot by making the size of the tile proportional to the number of students taking the gaokao. Guess what, you can barely find these three places no more because they all shrink to almost points. The number of students taking the gaokao is substantially lower in these three places compared to the other regions of China but with surprisingly high admission rates. Since, the size of these three plots become so small that I have to use ggrepel to label them individually.\nggplot(rates, aes(col, row)) +\rgeom_tile(aes(fill = rate*100, width = norm + 0.12, height = norm + 0.15), colour = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, size=0.75, linejoin = \u0026quot;round\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_label_repel(data = subset(rates, rate \u0026gt; 0.2), nudge_y = 0.5, nudge_x = 0.8, aes(label = paste0(province,\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;, round(rate, 2)*100)), size = 3.5, force = 10) +\rgeom_label_repel(data = subset(rates, pop \u0026gt; 60), nudge_y = 0.8, nudge_x = -1.1, aes(label = paste0(province,\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;, round(rate, 2)*100)), size = 3.5, force = 10) +\rscale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;#fde0dd\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;#c51b8a\u0026quot;, na.value = \u0026quot;#f0f0f0\u0026quot;, name = \u0026quot;Admissions\\nper 10,000\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot; Admission rates of Beijing/Tsinghua University in 2017\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)+\rtheme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;#f5f5f5\u0026quot;),\rplot.title = element_text(size=16, face=\u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, margin = margin(b = -20, t = 10)))\rThe same conclusion can be derived from the following two treemap plots using treemapify. I was planning to use the traditional scatter plots with different size of points but later became interested in trying this new way of showing the imbalanced proportions within groups. For example, Beijing is one of provinces in which fewest students took the exam but has the most students admitted to the top universities in China.\np1\u0026lt;- ggplot(rates, aes(area = pop, fill = rate*100, label = province)) +\rgeom_treemap() +\rgeom_treemap_text(colour = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, place = \u0026quot;centre\u0026quot;,\rgrow = TRUE) +\rscale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;#deebf7\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;#3182bd\u0026quot;, na.value = \u0026quot;#f0f0f0\u0026quot;, name = \u0026quot;Admissions\\nper 10,000\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot; Number of students taking the college entrance exam in 2017\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)+\rtheme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;#f5f5f5\u0026quot;),\rplot.title = element_text(size=16, face=\u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;))\rp2 \u0026lt;- ggplot(rates, aes(area = total, fill = rate*100, label = province)) +\rgeom_treemap() +\rgeom_treemap_text(colour = \u0026quot;White\u0026quot;, place = \u0026quot;centre\u0026quot;,\rgrow = TRUE) +\rscale_fill_gradient(low = \u0026quot;#fde0dd\u0026quot;, high = \u0026quot;#c51b8a\u0026quot;, na.value = \u0026quot;#f0f0f0\u0026quot;, name = \u0026quot;Admissions\\nper 10,000\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot; Number of students admitted to Beijing/Tsinghua University in 2017\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)+\rtheme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;#f5f5f5\u0026quot;),\rplot.title = element_text(size=16, face=\u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;))\rcowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol = 1)\r\r\r","date":1561680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561708800,"objectID":"1b34ac9de7def73f2aa52efaa749b0f5","permalink":"/post/gaokao/","publishdate":"2019-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/gaokao/","section":"post","summary":"data visualization of the college entrace exam data in 2017","tags":["R","Statistical analysis","Data viz"],"title":"How difficult it is to get into the top universities in China","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zhi Yang"],"categories":null,"content":" Background I worked for Jessica Barrington-Trimis (@Doctor_BT) on a project to look into the effect of e-cigarette use on cigarette use among adolescents. After we submitted the manuscript, Jessica suggested me presenting the results at the upcoming 2019 Meeting – College on Problems of Drug Dependence, San Antonio, TX. Meanwhile, she sent me a video link about transforming the current poster style. After watching it, I was totally down to get the new poster rolling. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard about it, you can read through the story written by NPR. And, you can also follow the updates by using the hashtag #betterposter.\nNew poster So, basically, my takeaway from this new trending way of making poster is that you just print one or two sentences at the top or in the middle with super large font size. What\u0026rsquo;s even better is that some genius already created an R package, posterdown, that allow R users to come up with a poster using R Markdown.\nIs that amazing? You don\u0026rsquo;t have to spend hours adjusting the alignments and sizes of texts and pictures. Everything can be just controlled by changing a number or argument in R Markdown. From now on, you can focus on the contents rather than tedious PPT work.\nAt the conference I ordered my poster online and had it delivered to the hotel. I was one of the few people who had the poster set up at the conference room at the day before. Apparently, I was a little bit worried about how the second day was going to turn out to be. My concerns were gone at the second day because I was too busy talking to peoples who stopped by to ask me questions about my poster. Here is what it looks like with me standing by it.\nDuring two-hour time span, I had talked to ~ 30 people, of which ten of them took a picture of my poster. Five of them were even asking me how I made it. At first, I was wondering whether people were interested in my poster is because of the study itself or the new poster style. Then, I realized that the very first question that almost everyone asked is, what is a mod? Obviously, it has to do with them seeing the conclusion printed with large font sizes. Without it, I doubt a third of them will even stop by, not mentioning having a conversation with me. Judging by this point, I think the new poster style is a success.\nConclusion If you are also interested in trying it out, you can check out the GitHub repo of my poster. I highly recommend trying it out for your next poster!\n","date":1561593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561622400,"objectID":"d54887a1583a44492fe191cbe0402df3","permalink":"/post/poster/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/poster/","section":"post","summary":"my first-time experience of making a trending new-style poster","tags":["R","Statistical analysis"],"title":"Yes!

Until very recently, I went to the SatRday Los Angeles conference 2019 at UCLA this year where Erin LeDell (@ledell) gave a keynote talk on scalable automatic machine learning with H2O. The elegant way she has navigated the model building process has fascinated me. Most importantly, H2O also has a very nice and friendly interface called H2O flow to users to quickly familiarize themselves with this tool. Here is a more detailed and official documentation of how to use H2O flow. But I\u0026rsquo;d like to highlight my favorite features.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started  First, go to the H2O website to download the zip file.\n Follow the instruction to unzip the file and run it from your terminal.\ncd Downloads unzip h2o-3.24.0.2.zip cd h2o-3.24.0.2 java -jar h2o.jar  Then type http://localhost:54321 in your browser.\n  Feature highlight  Notebook layout\nThe feature that I appreciate the most is the similar layout as the Jupyter notebook. By adopting the style of the existing tools, it saves the users time from learning using the new interface to really starting to adopt this new tool.\n Examples\nWithout too much efforts, new users can directly jump into the pipeline by opening the existing projects, i.e., deep learning, GBM, XGbBoost and etc.\n   Control Panel Examples          Running time\nAnother noticable feature of the flow is that users have a better sense of time cost of each component in the pipeline. The running time of each block is shown by default, which also improves the users engagement from using this new tool.\n Model diagnostics tools\nAfter the models are implemented and performed, the H2O flow generates a wide range of output for users to select from. Here are some examples from a project using GBM for airline classificaiton.\n   Scoring history ROC curve Variable importances            If you would like to know more, here is an article on Medium about democratising machine learning with H2O, which also introduces all the available H2O products including the driverless ai.

It was mentioned and recommended in the post written by Daniel Miller, a data scientist at Microsoft. I was a little suspicious at the first beginning because I don\u0026rsquo;t think there will be any free services in helping people with improving their interview skills. Normally, we get help from the school Careers Center. I do benefit a lot from visiting the Careers Center at the USC but they could only go this far to help with resume critique and behavioral questions. Anything technical or related to a specific position are beyond what they can offer. So, I am stuck!\nUntil I gave a try on this website, Pramp, it totally changed my perspectives on how to prepare a data scientist interview. Actually, early this year, I was invited by the recruiter to interview for a data scientist position at Google. The phone interview went well and I was invited for an on-site interview. I postponed the interview to early 2019 so I could prepare for it during the winter break. I spent most of my time practicing code and learning more new machine learning models. Later on, I realized that I was totally wrong through the entire process to ace a data scientist interview. None of my preparation touches the surface on how to evaluate a new feature to boost a company’s growth, i.e., how to increase the number of complete successful purchases or boost the growth of users. Obviously, the interview didn’t go well and even I knew it right away after four rounds of the interviews. After a week or two, the recruiter called me and told me that they’ve decided not to move on with my application. I was frustrated and still don’t know how to improve my situation. It’s totally changed after I went on practicing an interview on Pramp.\nThe entire process was very simple. During an hour session, two of the participants have the opportunities to play as interviewer and interviewee. I was given a case for a data scientist at Airbnb to ask how the applicant is going to do to improve the growth of successful online booking. My partner did well, actually, better. He did an awesome job in figuring all the questions being asked and almost hit the perfect answer for all of them. In contrast, I did bad and was not even saying things during the interview. It turned out I had hard time with concretizing the business questions to specific metrics to measure the success. What they would like to achieve at the end of the day? What data do we have and challenging would we be faced with in terms of getting the data ready for the next step? Sometimes, it was about what data could be available and possibly collected for this business questions. I’ve learned a lot during the interview and am excited for the next try!\nIf you will be interested in trying out this awesome website to enhance your interview skills, please check out here, Pramp. They’ve provided six tracks including applied data science, project manager, behavioral questions, and etc.. You can also read more about them on Medium. Hope this will help you to land your dream job soon!\n","date":1554336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554364800,"objectID":"fc83007172fb796daa586051b32169e2","permalink":"/post/pramp/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/pramp/","section":"post","summary":"What I've learned from practicing interviews on Pramp for the first time","tags":["R","Data Science"],"title":"What I learned from practicing interviews on Pramp.com","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zhi Yang","Priyatama Pandey","Darryl Shibata","David V.

Except for gaining more skills and doing projects to boost your profile, there is another way to make your profile more professional: finding the right header. No one will argue with the fact that the header picture helps with creating the first impression for recruiters and your future employers. To begin with creating a profile, it might take forever for you to pick their favorite picture as the header but still keep professional. Here is how to create your own unique header showing your professional skills! If you are an R user, here might be a good idea to create your own header with all your favorite R hex-stickers that is perfect and ready for LinkedIn and Twitter.\nLast year, I came across this post, USER!2018 Feature Wall, by Mitchell O\u0026rsquo;Hara-Wild. I was amazed about the design and aesthetics of this map. In the post, he described his experience of creating a feature wall for the useR!2018 and he wrote a package to do it as well. Today, we will use his codes to make our own header.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started  First, go to the GitHub repository mitchelloharawild/hexwall and follow his instructions to set everything up.\n Creat your own list of R stickers. Mitchell has recommended downloading from the RStudio hex-stickers from their GitHub repository (rstudio/hex-stickers). Mitchell has provided a folder with some sample stickers.

In addition, topic models also allow us to access the contribution of each topic and its representations across different documents. Human genomes have been exposed to an assortment of mutational processes by contributing to unique patterns of somatic mutations.

What would these “topics” tell us about the most important information for our health, genetic, risk factors for cancer and something more that slip under the radar?\n","date":1462086000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462086000,"objectID":"132cb86d42e57e9bc2a06d3b2a82d4bc","permalink":"/project/cancer/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/cancer/","section":"project","summary":"During my doctoral training, most of my research is focused on developing novel statistical methods for genomics data, specifically, cancer development and tumor growth.

The alcohol products in the resulting biofuels were dominated by the C2+ alcohols (mainly C2—C6 alcohols) with a content of 73.55%–89.98%. The selectivity of the liquid hydrocarbons (C5+) in the hydrocarbon products ranges from 60.37% to 70.94%. The synthesis biofuels also possess a higher heat value of 40.53–41.49 MJ/kg. The effects of the synthesis conditions, including temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity, on the biofuel synthesis were investigated in detail. The catalyst features were characterized by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, and the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms measurements. The present biofuel synthesis with a higher biofuel yield and a higher selectivity of liquid hydrocarbons and C2+ alcohols may be a potentially useful route to produce clean biofuels and chemicals from biomass.","tags":[],"title":"Highly efficient synthesis of clean biofuels from biomass using FeCuZnAlK catalyst","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feiyan Gong","Zhi Yang","Chenggui Hong","Weiwei Huang","Shen Ning","Zhaoxia Zhang","Yong Xu","Quanxin Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1317452400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1317452400,"objectID":"05d1bc8d22d30cc8d8164b57369cc7a4","permalink":"/publication/biooil/","publishdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/biooil/","section":"publication","summary":"Light olefins are the basic building blocks for the petrochemical industry. In this work, selective production of light olefins from catalytic cracking of bio-oil was performed by using the La/HZSM-5 catalyst. With a nearly complete conversion of bio-oil, the maximum yield reached 0.28 ± 0.02 kg olefins/(kg bio-oil), which was close to that from methanol. Addition of La into zeolite efficiently changed the total acid amount of HZSM-5, especially the acid distribution among the strong, medium and weak acid sites. A moderate increase of the number of the medium acid sites effectively enhanced the olefins selectivity and improved the catalyst stability. The comparison between the catalytic cracking and pyrolysis of bio-oil was studied. The mechanism of the conversion of bio-oil to light olefins was also discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Selective conversion of bio-oil to light olefins - controlling catalytic cracking for maximum olefins","type":"publication"}]
