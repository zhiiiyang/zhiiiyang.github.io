Until very recently, I went to the SatRday Los Angeles conference 2019 at UCLA this year where Erin LeDell (@ledell) gave a keynote talk on scalable automatic machine learning with H2O. The elegant way she has navigated the model building process has fascinated me. Most importantly, H2O also has a very nice and friendly interface called H2O flow to users to quickly familiarize themselves with this tool. Here is a more detailed and official documentation of how to use H2O flow. But I\u0026rsquo;d like to highlight my favorite features.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started  First, go to the H2O website to download the zip file.\n Follow the instruction to unzip the file and run it from your terminal.\ncd Downloads unzip h2o-3.24.0.2.zip cd h2o-3.24.0.2 java -jar h2o.jar  Then type http://localhost:54321 in your browser.\n  Feature highlight  Notebook layout\nThe feature that I appreciate the most is the similar layout as the Jupyter notebook. By adopting the style of the existing tools, it saves the users time from learning using the new interface to really starting to adopt this new tool.\n Examples\nWithout too much efforts, new users can directly jump into the pipeline by opening the existing projects, i.e., deep learning, GBM, XGbBoost and etc.\n   Control Panel Examples          Running time\nAnother noticable feature of the flow is that users have a better sense of time cost of each component in the pipeline. The running time of each block is shown by default, which also improves the users engagement from using this new tool.\n Model diagnostics tools\nAfter the models are implemented and performed, the H2O flow generates a wide range of output for users to select from. Here are some examples from a project using GBM for airline classificaiton.\n   Scoring history ROC curve Variable importances            If you would like to know more, here is an article on Medium about democratising machine learning with H2O, which also introduces all the available H2O products including the driverless ai. You can also find a list of publications using H2O here.\n","date":1556150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556150400,"objectID":"8399f9da9045ab2fa1e0556dce422857","permalink":"/post/h2o/","publishdate":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/h2o/","section":"post","summary":"A new user's experience with H2O Flow","tags":[],"title":"My experience with using H2O Flow","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554773400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554773400,"objectID":"108e566fbe77a00d43dd6db42773bffd","permalink":"/talk/jags/","publishdate":"2019-03-31T18:30:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/jags/","section":"talk","summary":"a gentle introduction on how to fit a simple Bayesian model, visualize and summarize the output using R2jags.","tags":["R","Bayesian inference"],"title":"Bayesian modeling with R2jags","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Zhi Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"I came across this website to prepare for people to ace interviews for data scientist jobs in the industry. It was mentioned and recommended in the post written by Daniel Miller, a data scientist at Microsoft. I was a little suspicious at the first beginning because I don\u0026rsquo;t think there will be any free services in helping people with improving their interview skills. Normally, we get help from the school Careers Center. I do benefit a lot from visiting the Careers Center at the USC but they could only go this far to help with resume critique and behavioral questions. Anything technical or related to a specific position are beyond what they can offer. So, I am stuck!\nUntil I gave a try on this website, Pramp, it totally changed my perspectives on how to prepare a data scientist interview. Actually, early this year, I was invited by the recruiter to interview for a data scientist position at Google. The phone interview went well and I was invited for an on-site interview. I postponed the interview to early 2019 so I could prepare for it during the winter break. I spent most of my time practicing code and learning more new machine learning models. Later on, I realized that I was totally wrong through the entire process to ace a data scientist interview. None of my preparation touches the surface on how to evaluate a new feature to boost a company’s growth, i.e., how to increase the number of complete successful purchases or boost the growth of users. Obviously, the interview didn’t go well and even I knew it right away after four rounds of the interviews. After a week or two, the recruiter called me and told me that they’ve decided not to move on with my application. I was frustrated and still don’t know how to improve my situation. It’s totally changed after I went on practicing an interview on Pramp.\nThe entire process was very simple. During an hour session, two of the participants have the opportunities to play as interviewer and interviewee. I was given a case for a data scientist at Airbnb to ask how the applicant is going to do to improve the growth of successful online booking. My partner did well, actually, better. He did an awesome job in figuring all the questions being asked and almost hit the perfect answer for all of them. In contrast, I did bad and was not even saying things during the interview. It turned out I had hard time with concretizing the business questions to specific metrics to measure the success. What they would like to achieve at the end of the day? What data do we have and challenging would we be faced with in terms of getting the data ready for the next step? Sometimes, it was about what data could be available and possibly collected for this business questions. I’ve learned a lot during the interview and am excited for the next try!\nIf you will be interested in trying out this awesome website to enhance your interview skills, please check out here, Pramp. They’ve provided six tracks including applied data science, project manager, behavioral questions, and etc.. You can also read more about them on Medium. Hope this will help you to land your dream job soon!\n","date":1554336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554364800,"objectID":"fc83007172fb796daa586051b32169e2","permalink":"/post/pramp/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/pramp/","section":"post","summary":"What I've learned from practicing interviews on Pramp for the first time","tags":["R, Data Science"],"title":"What I learned from practicing interviews on Pramp.com","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zhi Yang","Priyatama Pandey","Darryl Shibata","David V.

Except for gaining more skills and doing projects to boost your profile, there is another way to make your profile more professional: finding the right header. No one will argue with the fact that the header picture helps with creating the first impression for recruiters and your future employers. To begin with creating a profile, it might take forever for you to pick their favorite picture as the header but still keep professional. Here is how to create your own unique header showing your professional skills! If you are an R user, here might be a good idea to create your own header with all your favorite R hex-stickers that is perfect and ready for LinkedIn and Twitter.\nLast year, I came across this post, USER!2018 Feature Wall, by Mitchell O\u0026rsquo;Hara-Wild. I was amazed about the design and aesthetics of this map. In the post, he described his experience of creating a feature wall for the useR!2018 and he wrote a package to do it as well. Today, we will use his codes to make our own header.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started  First, go to the GitHub repository mitchelloharawild/hexwall and follow his instructions to set everything up.\n Creat your own list of R stickers. Mitchell has recommended downloading from the RStudio hex-stickers from their GitHub repository (rstudio/hex-stickers). Mitchell has provided a folder with some sample stickers. Add more your favorite stickers into that folder.\n If you prefer some stickers at a particular position, i.e., RStudio hex sticker comes as the first one. Then, you should rename those files to make sure they appear in the right order. Here is a quick peek into my stickers list folder.\n By run the following two lines of code, you will get a perfect and professional R stickers wall header for your LinkedIn and Twitter profile.\nsource('hexwall.R') hexwall(\u0026quot;samplelist\u0026quot;, sticker_row_size = 7, sticker_width = 200)   ","date":1548720000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554278400,"objectID":"072addee5fd94a867d6a12b03c6b57d1","permalink":"/post/hexwall/","publishdate":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hexwall/","section":"post","summary":"Learn how to make a header with R hex-stickers for LinkedIn and Twitter.","tags":["R, RStudio"],"title":"Learn how to make a header with R hex-stickers for LinkedIn and Twitter","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547083800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547083800,"objectID":"1e78f848fbe582f5d4dd2a3d6f1cb2f9","permalink":"/talk/rladies/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T18:30:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rladies/","section":"talk","summary":"An example talk on developing good pratices in R","tags":["R","RStudio"],"title":"Good practices in R","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536476400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536476400,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533070800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533070800,"objectID":"6a56992a49f9e3dfef6baf6552e67e58","permalink":"/talk/jsmtalk/","publishdate":"2018-07-31T14:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/jsmtalk/","section":"talk","summary":"An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.","tags":["Bayesian inference","R"],"title":"Statistical approach for investigating change in mutational processes during cancer growth and development","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project is focused on studying e-cigarette Product Characteristics and Frequency of Smoking Among Young Adults.
