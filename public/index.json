The alcohol products in the resulting biofuels were dominated by the C2+ alcohols (mainly C2—C6 alcohols) with a content of 73.55%–89.98%. The selectivity of the liquid hydrocarbons (C5+) in the hydrocarbon products ranges from 60.37% to 70.94%. The synthesis biofuels also possess a higher heat value of 40.53–41.49 MJ/kg. The effects of the synthesis conditions, including temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity, on the biofuel synthesis were investigated in detail. The catalyst features were characterized by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, and the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms measurements. The present biofuel synthesis with a higher biofuel yield and a higher selectivity of liquid hydrocarbons and C2+ alcohols may be a potentially useful route to produce clean biofuels and chemicals from biomass.","tags":[],"title":"Highly efficient synthesis of clean biofuels from biomass using FeCuZnAlK catalyst","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feiyan Gong","Zhi Yang","Chenggui Hong","Weiwei Huang","Shen Ning","Zhaoxia Zhang","Yong Xu","Quanxin Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1317452400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1317452400,"objectID":"05d1bc8d22d30cc8d8164b57369cc7a4","permalink":"/publication/biooil/","publishdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/biooil/","section":"publication","summary":"Light olefins are the basic building blocks for the petrochemical industry. In this work, selective production of light olefins from catalytic cracking of bio-oil was performed by using the La/HZSM-5 catalyst. With a nearly complete conversion of bio-oil, the maximum yield reached 0.28 ± 0.02 kg olefins/(kg bio-oil), which was close to that from methanol. Addition of La into zeolite efficiently changed the total acid amount of HZSM-5, especially the acid distribution among the strong, medium and weak acid sites. A moderate increase of the number of the medium acid sites effectively enhanced the olefins selectivity and improved the catalyst stability. The comparison between the catalytic cracking and pyrolysis of bio-oil was studied. The mechanism of the conversion of bio-oil to light olefins was also discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Selective conversion of bio-oil to light olefins - controlling catalytic cracking for maximum olefins","type":"publication"}]
