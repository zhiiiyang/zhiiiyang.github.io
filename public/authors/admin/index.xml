      <title>How difficult it is to get into the top universities in China</title>

      <description>BackgroundIn June of 2019, over 10 millions students took the gaokao, the college entrace exam in China. This exam varies by province to province, so it is the admission rate to the top universities (Beijing/Tsinghua University). I often get asked how difficult to get into those two schools in China. I hope this data visualization will help you understand the admission rates of the top universities across different provinces in China by using the data in 2017.</description>

      <description>Background I worked for Jessica Barrington-Trimis (@Doctor_BT) on a project to look into the effect of e-cigarette use on cigarette use among adolescents. After we submitted the manuscript, Jessica suggested me presenting the results at the upcoming 2019 Meeting â€“ College on Problems of Drug Dependence, San Antonio, TX. Meanwhile, she sent me a video link about transforming the current poster style. After watching it, I was totally down to get the new poster rolling.</description>

      <title>My experience with using H2O Flow</title>
      <link>/post/h2o/</link>

      <guid>/post/h2o/</guid>
      <description>Background I came across H2O several times in the past couple of years but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to try it out by myself. Until very recently, I went to the SatRday Los Angeles conference 2019 at UCLA this year where Erin LeDell (@ledell) gave a keynote talk on scalable automatic machine learning with H2O. The elegant way she has navigated the model building process has fascinated me. Most importantly, H2O also has a very nice and friendly interface called H2O flow to users to quickly familiarize themselves with this tool.</description>

      <title>What I learned from practicing interviews on Pramp.com</title>

      <description>I came across this website to prepare for people to ace interviews for data scientist jobs in the industry. It was mentioned and recommended in the post written by Daniel Miller, a data scientist at Microsoft. I was a little suspicious at the first beginning because I don&amp;rsquo;t think there will be any free services in helping people with improving their interview skills. Normally, we get help from the school Careers Center.</description>
