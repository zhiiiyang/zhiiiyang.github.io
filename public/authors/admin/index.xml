      <title>My experience with using H2O Flow</title>

      <description>Background I came across H2O several times in the past couple of years but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to try it out by myself. Until very recently, I went to the SatRday Los Angeles conference 2019 at UCLA this year where Erin LeDell (@ledell) gave a keynote talk on scalable automatic machine learning with H2O. The elegant way she has navigated the model building process has fascinated me. Most importantly, H2O also has a very nice and friendly interface called H2O flow to users to quickly familiarize themselves with this tool.</description>

      <description>I came across this website to prepare for people to ace interviews for data scientist jobs in the industry. It was mentioned and recommended in the post written by Daniel Miller, a data scientist at Microsoft. I was a little suspicious at the first beginning because I don&amp;rsquo;t think there will be any free services in helping people with improving their interview skills. Normally, we get help from the school Careers Center.</description>
