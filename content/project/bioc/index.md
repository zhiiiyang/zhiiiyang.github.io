[GeoDiff](https://bioconductor.unipi.it/packages/3.15/bioc/html/GeoDiff.html): A series of statistical models using count generating distributions for background modelling, feature and sample QC, normalization and differential expression analysis on GeoMx RNA data. The application of these methods are demonstrated by example data analysis vignette.


[GeomxTools](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GeomxTools.html): Tools for NanoString Technologies GeoMx Technology. Package provides functions for reading in DCC and PKC files based on an ExpressionSet derived object. Normalization and QC functions are also included.


[NanoStringNCTools](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/NanoStringNCTools.html): Tools for NanoString Technologies nCounter Technology. Provides support for reading RCC files into an ExpressionSet derived object. Also includes methods for QC and normalizaztion of NanoString data.


[HiLDA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/HiLDA.html): A package built under the Bayesian framework of applying hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation. It statistically tests whether the mutational exposures of mutational signatures (Shiraishi-model signatures) are different between two groups. The package also provides inference and visualization.


[selectKSigs](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/selectKSigs.html): A package to suggest the number of mutational signatures in a collection of somatic mutations using calculating the cross-validated perplexity score.
