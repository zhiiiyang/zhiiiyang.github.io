abstract: (HiLDA) for characterizing somatic mutation data in cancer. The method allows us to infer mutational patterns and their relative frequencies in a set of tumor mutational catalogs and to compare the estimated frequencies between tumor sets. We apply our method to somatic mutations in colon cancer with mutations classified by the time of occurrence, before or after tumor initiation. Applying the methods to 16 colon cancers, we found significant associations between the relative frequencies of mutational patterns and the time of occurrence of mutations. Our novel method provides higher statistical power for detecting differences in mutational signatures.

summary: We propose a hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation model (HiLDA) for characterizing somatic mutation data in cancer. The method allows us to infer mutational patterns and their relative frequencies in a set of tumor mutational catalogs and to compare the estimated frequencies between tumor sets.
