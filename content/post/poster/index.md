## Background
I worked for Jessica Barrington-Trimis ([@Doctor_BT](https://twitter.com/Doctor_BT)) on a project to look into the effect of e-cigarette use on cigarette use among adolescents. After we submitted the manuscript, Jessica suggested me presenting the results at the upcoming 2019 Meeting â€“ College on Problems of Drug Dependence, San Antonio, TX. Meanwhile, she sent me a video [link](https://youtu.be/1RwJbhkCA58) about transforming the current poster style. After watching it, I was totally down to get the new poster rolling. If you haven't heard about it, you can read through the [story](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/06/11/729314248/to-save-the-science-poster-researchers-want-to-kill-it-and-start-over) written by NPR. And, you can also follow the updates by using the hashtag [#betterposter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/betterposter?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag).

What's even better is that some genius already created an R package, [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown), that allow R users to come up with a poster using R Markdown.

Is that amazing? You don't have to spend hours adjusting the alignments and sizes of texts and pictures. Everything can be just controlled by changing a number or argument in R Markdown. From now on, you can focus on the contents rather than tedious PPT work. 

## At the conference 
I ordered my poster online and had it delivered to the hotel. I was one of the few people who had the poster set up at the conference room at the day before. Apparently, I was a little bit worried about how the second day was going to turn out to be. My concerns were gone at the second day because I was too busy talking to peoples who stopped by to ask me questions about my poster. Here is what it looks like with me standing by it.

During two-hour time span, I had talked to **~ 30 people**, of which ten of them took a picture of my poster. Five of them were even asking me how I made it. I was
