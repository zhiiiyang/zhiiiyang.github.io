abstract: Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. R2jags is an R package that allows us to implement Bayesian analysis by using JAGS in R. In this talk, I'll give a gentle introduction on how to fit a simple Bayesian model, visualize and summarize the output using R2jags.
